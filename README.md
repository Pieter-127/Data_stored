# Data_stored

Some basic UI work and messing around with Proto datastore (found a design i thought was cool [here](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/party-planner-mobile-app))

# Summary
I did this project to do some UI work, this layout seemed pretty bright and fun to make, afterwards added in some really basic datastore code to see how it works
This project _really_ isn't optimized, it's just a playground for datastore and learning how to define proto models
# How it's done
The app makes use of Kotlin, Material Components, Coroutines, Flow and Datastore

# How would you run this ? 
You can simply clone this from github and open the project using android studio
